# Trump
In honour of our newly elected president, I thought it would be fun to see how many people are talking about Donald Trump. I decided to search a very
popular website, and one of my favourites, Reddit. Using PRAW 4, I searched 10 subreddits, mostly political subreddits, and took the top
100 'hot' posts and searched how many of those titles contained the word either donald or trump. I also added an initial input keyword from
the user that is searched alongside the words donald and trump that is included in the output.
Subreddits searched : ['The_Donald', 'EnoughTrumpSpam', 'politics', 'news', 'hillaryclinton', 'worldpolitics', 'Business', 'uspolitics', 'AmericanPolitics', 'Republican']
